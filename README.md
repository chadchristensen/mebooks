## Project Notes:

Mebooks was developed for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a week-long sprint to integrate MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js into a Single Page App (SPA).

## Overview
#### Concept / Product Catalyst:

Bedtime is a four letter word to some children.  Not anymore!  With mebooks you can personalize their bedtime stories by creating a cartoon character in their likeness and using their name in the story.
